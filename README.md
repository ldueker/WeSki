To hookup to an existing OpenAI LLM using an API key, replace the "your_key" with your private API key after creating an account and setting up a private API key on OpenAI. More information on creating an account, setting up a private API key, and choosing an LLM can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys


promptTester.ipynb is a unit tester for individual prompts.  The prompt and input variables can be edited to test how the LLM is responding to a variety of prompts.  Follow the steps in the notebook to set the API key for the promptTester.
